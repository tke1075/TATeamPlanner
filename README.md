This is a simple version of the TA Team Capacity Planner.

## How to Deploy on Vercel

1. Upload all files (index.html, style.css, script.js) into a GitHub repo.
2. Connect the repo to Vercel.
3. Choose `index.html` as the root entry point.
4. Deploy and test the form.

You can build on this by adding additional logic, charts, PDF/Excel export, and team breakdowns.
